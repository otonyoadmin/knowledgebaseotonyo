How many times have we heard it, how many times have we said it, to others and ourself, _'Stop taking it personally, its just business',_ how many times has the personal needs of a friend, partner or family member been neglected because we say we must work. 
Without being aware of it we are all trained to put our personal needs second and clearly that makes sense generally or we could never have a meeting where even 40% of the time you spent there was valued and used economically. The problem here is not to begin by changing the Corporate Culture first the challenge here is to examine how we are taling with ourselves.
This is not simply an issue of the dangers inherent in the build up of resentment, resentment which mounts in proportion to continuosly experiencing regection each tim personal experience deemed less important to the existing agenda. When this hierarchy that relegates our own personal experiences infiltrates our internal self reflection we are on the cusp of significent life long problem where we will lack the capacity for objectivity in this matter.
