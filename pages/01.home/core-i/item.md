Within Agile Self Management the Core-i is the name given to the ideal framing of our main personal 'I'.

Each user of AS M devises, styles and modifies their own individual Core-i using, what they will, of foundational ideal conceptions of the charecter and nature of the Core-i, given two key functions of the Core-i:
* Agile Self Management seeks to integrate emergent human knowledge as effortlessly and as rapidly as possible into Positive Participation in Role-i's, including the Core-i.
* The Core-i serves as the vehicle for enabling and synthetically integrating Self will and i-Role will.
