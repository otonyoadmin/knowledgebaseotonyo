Within Agile Self Management identities and identifications are similar in core nature as they are both considered as holons.

* Identities can be personal 'I' identities such as I am a sister (sibling), I am a supervisor (work role), I am a friend (personal role). They can also be internal 'I' identities related to recursive mindset identities which Self reflect, such as my-Critic-I, which critically reflects upon an event or person or my-Optimistic-I which always sees the glass half full with regard to an event or a person.

* Identifications are denoted by recurring attittudes in mindsets which arise when we become identified in a place and time such as being acting out of nervousness in the presence of someone who matters to you personally or professionally or acting out of patterned behaviour in response to particular stimulus such as joining an unfamiliar group of people in a social setting.
