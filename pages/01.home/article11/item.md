Enabling wonderful, well, new horizons within our own individual mind, so that we may participate positevely, in the flow of human perception, in a life worth living, with joy, depends upon us continously opening the necessary ceilings in our minds I's.

The I's we are in temporal circumstances are necessarily pragmatic as they exist in relationship to dependent, defined purposes, meanings and values.

Authenticated human knowlege is emergent in nature, a continous flow, what we know now for sure is that all that we consider ourselves to know now cannot be affirmed as knowledge unless it is constantly open to question revalidation, truth is the primer of knowledge. 

A truth discovered today may overturn yesterdays knowledge patterns

With the advances in human logic over the past 300 years we may reasonaly consider 'Truth' a verification impremata which may be validly given to certain stable circumstances or prcessess in relationship with our continuosly dyanmic and emergent human knowledge. 

The cage within which we live is of our own making, whatever adheres to the walls of our mind, in a free world, is determined by the adhesive tendencies we invoke in our identities. We are thought to claim valid mental acuity if we perform within confines of notions of the educated properly informed mind.
Widening the floors of the cage
