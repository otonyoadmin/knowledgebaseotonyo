# Exploring Our Objects Of Desire
#### Generally within Agile Self Management, all named or nameable desires may be considered as 'objects of desire'.
Objects of desire are bound by time and culture in relationship with personal age and experience.

Understanding and remaining aware of the constantly changing value of our objects of desire can be helped if we simply reflect for a moment upon our current objects of desire and how they are directly related to they mean to us at the moment. We can see upon reflection how their meaning has changed within us as we learn and evolve through our experiences over time as our purposes change.

The objects we desire today are often different to those which we desired 10 or 20 years ago and many of the objects of desire we had 10 or 20 years ago may now be considered as undesirable.
