Once Door Psychosynthesis, uses Desire Dyanmics to provide a new conception of Self and Self will as love. This new Self conception is accommadated and differentiated from 'I' identifications and I-will (identified will) conceptions, as uniquely and consitently originating from desieless emptiness.

'I' identifications are deemed to be functional, pragmatic and attached to time bound outcomes, which are therefore limited and closed by virtue of their own culturally nature in space time..

The easy to use i-path mapping methods that include Desire Profiles and Role Profiles, make it possible to more inclusively define, refine, understand and synthetically integrate culturally bound goals with Self-will goals.
