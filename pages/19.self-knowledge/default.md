The method is essentially practical in nature as it takes account our actual everyday experiences as individuals in relationship with our refined objects of desire. 

This truthful inner monitoring and accounting of the practical experiences which accompany our successful consumption of our objects of desire enables us to determine and refine the unique individual value and meaning of particular enagaged participation by each of us. 

Self knowledge is at the heart of Agile Self Management and because the nature of the Self is essentially empty the Self knowledge is naturally dynamic and arises in relationship with lived experiences and identities which we inhabit such as recurring personal and inner 'I' identities.

The Agile part of the work inables the continuous integration of new knowledge gained through experience and intelligent reflection. The Self is revealed in its capacity and willingness to be receptive to constatntly varying yet similar manafestations of personal and and inner 'I' idenities which enables the clear definitition and refinement of poasitive participaiton. The successful management is enabled by the integration of intelligent monitoring and appraisal of experience in everyday life.
